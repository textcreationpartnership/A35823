         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:32504:4"/>moſt Reformed. The general un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquaintedneſs with the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Goſpell; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the ſolemn Aſſemblies by the Corruption of its Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and Worship, and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour caſt upon its moſt ſacred inſtitutions; the late terrible Deſolations of the Temple and Sanctuary, and grievous ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of our Brethren in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of the World; the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mefull Apoſtacy of ſo many Thouſands from the doctrine and worship of the Goſpel to Popish Idololatry; and other conſiderations of this kind, which might be nam'd, do carry with them a loud Call to Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and mourning.</p>
            <p>But the Practical Degeneracy
<pb facs="tcp:32504:4"/>of Profeſſing Chriſtians unto Worldlineſs, Profaneſs, and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, doth not only afford matter of Lamentation for the preſent but too much ground to Fear, that <hi>the bitterneſs of Death is not paſt;</hi> God's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is not turned away, or his Controverſie ended with the Proteſtant Churches. And after we have known ſo many Thouſands to renounce and abjure their Religion in an Hour of Temptation, and ſee ſo many more, yea the far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part, in a preparedneſs to Revolt, on the like or leſſer Trials, by reaſon of their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Lives, and eſtranged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from the Power of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, (becauſe they receive
<pb facs="tcp:32504:5"/>not the Truth in the Love of it,) what can we reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, but farther Tokens of Divine Diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>And how little of any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging proſpect is there, by the ſerious Reformation of Perſons, Families, and Churches to turn away his wrath? where are there any Symptoms of the Recovery of the Power of Godlineſs, from whence in our Age there is ſo undeniable a Declenſion? (and acknowledg'd by all Parties that there is ſo.) How little is to be ſeen of any ſuch thing, among thoſe who are moſt forward and zealous in eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſing the Reformed inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt? ev'n ſuch as would be
<pb facs="tcp:32504:5"/>thought of all Others to be moſt concern'd for its Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and have ſuffer'd not a little for it?</p>
            <p>The diſtreſſed caſe of our Brethren (eſpecially in <hi>France,</hi>) cannot but move our Bowells of Compaſſion, when we read or hear from time to time the Relation of the barbarous proceedings of their Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors. But the ſenſual wicked Lives of profeſſedly Reformed Chriſtians, is certainly a more dreadfull object to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and ought ſo to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by us, as the conſequences of it are much more to be feared, then of the feirceſt <hi>Perſecution</hi> by open and avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed Enimies. For the Curch of
<pb facs="tcp:32504:6"/>Chriſt never loſt either <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Holineſs</hi> that way: it hath rather been a conſiderable out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Means, for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and encreaſe of Both. (Tho this cannot be ſaid, but the direct Contrary, concerning Proteſtants perſecuting one another for leſſer differences)</p>
            <p>And what ever Expectations we may and ought to have, from the unfulfill'd <hi>Prophecies,</hi> of God's rebuilding Sion, in the latter days, &amp; deſtroying her E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimies; (wich we have no reaſon to queſtion but he will moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly effect, and ought dayly to pray that he would haſten it, for his Names ſake:) yet can we never hope to ſee any thing conſiderable of that kind, in
<pb facs="tcp:32504:6"/>our Time, without a great <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Reformation,</hi> and the <hi>more Plentifull Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out of the H. Spirit for the healing oſ the Nations.</hi> I the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore wish that the confident Expectations of a ſpeedy deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of the Church, may not divert us from the preſent Duty we are call'd to, as the proper appointed Means, to which God hath directed us for that end.</p>
            <p>And are there any hopefull Beginnings of ſuch a Thing, within view? is there any thing on foot to be obſerv'd, like ſuch a Retrieving of <hi>Goſpel Holineſs</hi> in the Hearts and Lives of men? Doth not the Name and Thing grow more and more into Contempt every day? and
<pb facs="tcp:32504:7"/>who can tell how far it may proceed, to procure Judgment upon any particular Place or Country, that is guilty of ſo general, and provoking a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection?</p>
            <p>It concerns us therefore, every one to look to himſelf; to Repent, and do our firſt Works, and make our Peace with God, that we may be found within the ſmal number of thoſe, who shall be thought worthy to eſcape the allmoſt Epidemical infection, and <hi>to ſtand before the Son of Man.</hi> On which Account, any thing that is likely to awaken Men to the Conſideration of the great acknowledg'd Principles of Religion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb facs="tcp:32504:7"/>be unſeaſonable. Yea in ſuch a caſe the meaneſt, and weakeſt Endeavors may be of ſome uſe. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions are moſt of them of that kind, neceſſary to be attended to by all ſorts, of Perſons; and ſo cannot be too often preſt, tho in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Manners.</p>
            <p>The uſefullneſs of the ſubject Matter, and the ſmallneſs of the Bulk, are two things which are wont to recommend a Book to moſt Readers. For which reaſon, I may Hope, this will be read by ſeveral, who ſuffer much better, becauſe bigger, books to ly by
<pb facs="tcp:32504:8"/>them neglected. Some may poſſibly give it the reading, as <hi>a New-years Gift.</hi> And who even ſhall be ſo far perſuaded by it, as to ſet a part ſome Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me in the beginning of the Year, for Self-examination, Confeſſion of Sin, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Thanksgiving, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn renewall of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, (which ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of theſe Reflexions may not only excite to, but are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to direct and aſſiſt him in,) I am perſuaded he will thank me for putting him in mind at leaſt, of ſo ſeaſonable an Exerciſe. The greateſt part of theſe Meditations were begun on a <hi>New-years Day,</hi> tho ſome others are thought
<pb facs="tcp:32504:8"/>fit to be inſerted, as tendign to promote the ſame deſign. But knowing how much eaſier it is, to ſtirr up other mens Devotion, then to command and keep ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve my own; 'tis deſir'd that ſome of the moſt devout Thoughts contained in theſe papers may be lookt upon as what the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor aims at, and would perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de to rather then what he hath allready attain'd: as what he knows he ought to be and do, and doth ſeriouſly endeavor, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then what he is, and hath been: heartily lamenting wherin he hath been faulty or defective in ſuch Duties, as theſe and the like Reflexions do oblige to, and enforce upon All who ſhall read them, and therefore
<pb facs="tcp:32504:9"/>much more upon him ſelf.</p>
            <p>That they were penn'd at ſeveral times, and in occaſional retirements for Spiritual Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, will with the difference of the ſubject be a ſufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe that ſome are larger, and others ſhorter, and that the ſtile is in ſome places more neglected then in others. If I may he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby render any ſervice to then Souls of men, if any ſecure Sinner, any ſelf deceiving Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, or backſliding Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian be hereby awaken'd, or any ſerious Believer's Devotion be quicken'd and advanc'd, I hope God will accept it. To his Bleſſing I humbly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it, for thoſe Ends.</p>

            <p>UPon the deliverance of the Jews out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the firſt moneth which began with the new Moon next to the vernal Equinox, was to be acounted <hi>the Beginning of Moneths, Exod.</hi> 12:2. it anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers to the latter end of our <hi>March,</hi> &amp; the Beginning of <hi>April;</hi> &amp; is ſometimes called <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan,</hi> &amp; ſometimes <hi>Abib.</hi> It was

A Period ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable &amp; extraordinary, as that was to the Jews, deſerved very well to be particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred &amp; taken notice of: &amp; might juſtly be acounted the <hi>Firſt,</hi> or chiefeſt <hi>of their moneths.</hi> And by comparing <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.41. with <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17. it may be concluded that <hi>Abraham</hi> received the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> on the fifteenth day of this moneth: &amp; 't is computed that about the ſame time of the year <hi>Iſaac</hi> was born; &amp; the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> afterward erected in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

            <p>As that <hi>Redemption of Iſrael</hi> from their Bondage in Aegypt, was but a type of a more glorious <hi>one</hi> by the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> (which all the World are concerned in as well the Jews) he was pleaſed to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Death in this moneth. 18. <hi>John.</hi> 28. According to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, the moneth <hi>Tisri,</hi> which began with the firſt new moon next to the Autumnal Equinox, is in ſeveral places of H.

For this reaſon, <hi>the Feaſt of Tabernacles,</hi> (or the Feaſt of Harveſts, on the 15. day of this moneth, when the Fruits of the Earth were gathered in,) is ſaid to be in the end of the year. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.16. This moneth <hi>Tisri</hi> anſwers to part of our <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:32504:16"/>&amp; part of <hi>October.</hi> About this Time of the year is moſt commonly reckon'd, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world; the Birth &amp; Baptiſm of <hi>J.

There were as many Feaſts &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Solemnities Apointed to the Jews in this moneth, as in all the year beſides. The <hi>Eighty firſt Pſalm,</hi> compoſed by <hi>Aſaph,</hi> for the firſt day of this moneth, or the Feaſt of Trumpets, is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have been in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of that Deliverance of Iſrael out of AEgipt:<note place="margin">Hammond. in loc.</note> the ſounding of Trumpets being a token of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>

By others termed <hi>Feſtum Cornu,</hi> the Feaſt of the Horn. But it is more probable, that this name was not given, with any reſpect to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> but on the account of that <hi>kind of Trumpets,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hoſpinian. de Feſt. Judaic.</note> which where then ſounded, viz, ſuch as were made of ſheeps or <hi>rams horns.</hi> Others think it to have been Apointed as a gratefull
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:32504:17"/>remembrance of former victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which God had afforded them.

The extraordinary Blowing of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets by the Prieſts at this time, (in all their Cities, as well as at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, where two ſilver Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets were alſo uſed at the Temple,<note place="margin">Lightfoot.

               <hi>Maimonides,</hi> the famous Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Rabbin, thinks the ſounding of Trumpets at this time was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to ſignifie ſome ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation as this, <hi>Ariſe O ye ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Some have imagined a typical Repreſentation of the <hi>two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants</hi> in this Feaſt. The old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant figured by the year paſſed; and the Covenant of Grace, or the Goſpell ſtate by the new year
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:32504:18"/>then began, and that by the ſound of Trumpets was prefigured the future preaching of the Goſpel, according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Their ſound went forth unto all the Earth, and their words unto the end of the world;</hi> and ſo the Feaſt of Trumpets is abrogated by the preaching of the Goſpel, if that were typically ſignified by it. Without ſuppoſing any Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe here, in a ſtrict and proper ſens; we may ye farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Parallel, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve, how the Joy and Gratitude that thes Trumpets did excite, is exceeded by that greater rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, promiſed and foretold by the Prophets, when the Glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Goſpel of Salvation by the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht to the world. 54 <hi>Iſ.</hi> 1. 2 <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 4 <hi>Gal.</hi> 27. which hath been in part accompliſht: and will be more compleat, in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:32504:18"/>of Peace and Purity, which Chriſt will eſtabliſh upon earth, towards the end of the World: and ſhall be finally perfected at the end of Time: when Days and Years, and Time thus meaſured, ſhall be no more. But the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiâh, our B. Saviour, having fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht his mediatory undertaking as to what concerns <hi>Earth,</hi> ſhall come againe from <hi>Heaven,</hi> with <hi>the Trump of God,</hi> to raiſe the Dead, and ſummon all the world to their final Judgement. Then ſhall he deliver up the Kingdom to his Father: and the Faithfull enter into <hi>the Joy of their Lord,</hi> and be for ever with him.</p>
            <p>There is a Tradition among the Jews mentioned by <hi>Maimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Canones Poenit. cap <hi>3.</hi> can. <hi>5.</hi>
               </note> that on the firſt day of the new year, God enters into Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the ſins of the year and Life paſt. That every ones Faults are weighed againſt his good

            <p>And 't is a general cuſtom that hath obtained among the Jews, for the ten firſt days of the new-year, to riſe out of their Beds in the night, and to continue in their Synagogues praying and worſhipping, untill break of day.

               <hi>modern Jews</hi> on this Day, I ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat. However vaine and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ſuperſtitious, and abſurd many of their Cuſtoms, and Practiſes are on this day: yet this blind Devotion of the <hi>Iews</hi> may juſtly ſhame and condemn the Chriſtians of our Age: who commonly ſpend the Beginnings of every year worſe then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of them; and inſtead
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:32504:19"/>of any ſolemn Retirements for Prayer and Meditation, which might aſſiſt them to number their Days, and prepare for Eternity; inſtead, I ſay, of ſuch ſeaſonable Exercizes, how do vaine and hurtfull Sports and Paſtimes, or trifling and unedifying mirth, and fruitleſs converſations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the greateſt part of the Days, (and nights too) of the Beginning of the year! And thus when the firſt fruits of the year are offered up to ſin and vanity, 't is no wonder if the following parts of it are imployed to no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter purpoſe: without any due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for the Soul, and an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting State.</p>
            <p>To Endeavor ſome Remedy to thoſe diſorders, and give ſome aſſiſtance to them who deſire ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to make Religion their Principal Buſineſs, is the end of publiſhing thes Reflexions. I moſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:32504:20"/>heartily beſeech the God of a-Grace to influence by his H. Spil rit, the Conſcience of every Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that ſome ſuch effect may be attained. Haveing found the Practiſe recommended, to be of uſe to my ſelf; and my own Heart warmed in compoſing the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of thes Papers, (tho with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Intention at that Time of expoſing them to the world,) 'tis not unreaſonable to hope, that what hath been beneficial to one, may be helpfull to another. It cannot certainly be unadviſable or improper to Begin the year with God, with whom we ſhould begin every Day. 'T is decorous and becoming, to Dedicate our ſelves to Him, in a more ſolemn manner then ordinary, at ſuch a Time: Thankfully to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg <hi>the Favors</hi> and <hi>Bleſſings</hi> we have particularly received the Year Paſt: and to recollect the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:32504:20"/>
               <hi>Sins</hi> we have been guilty of; to aggravate them with Humility, Contrition, and deep Remorſe: to renew our <hi>Covenant</hi> with God: to repeat and fortifie our <hi>Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of living better: imploring his Grace to aſſiſt us in it: to reflect ſeriouſly on the mutability, frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, brevity of our <hi>preſent Life:</hi> to conſider the ſwiftneſs, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, irrecoverableneſs, and conſequent value of our <hi>Time:</hi> to look forward to a Bleſſed, or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable <hi>Eternity,</hi> one of which we muſt ſhare in; and to confirm our Faith in the <hi>Certainty</hi> therof, and conſider our near aproach to ſuch an unchangeable State: to think what improvement we ſhould make of the <hi>Death</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, eſpecially of Relations: and Friends, who have lately been called home: To make the <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi> in good earneſt, that we may follow them <hi>this year,</hi> and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:32504:21"/>dye before another new years day; to imprint ſuch a Thought on our Hearts, and the inferences that may naturally be deduced from it: to beg of God, to inable us to Redeem our Time, and diſcharge the Duty of our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular places; and prepare us for all the Events of the following year; and ſo effectually <hi>Teach us to number our days; that we may apply our Hearts unto true Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:</hi> leaſt we be ſurprized by an unexpected Death before the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of another year. And <hi>laſtly</hi> to pray for our Relations, and Friends, Families and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, and our Enemies too; and plead with God on the behalf of Sion, and the afflicted State of the Reformed Churches. To ſome of thes and the like Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, I hope what is here offered, may be ſubſervient: if conſidered with ſeriousneſs and application,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:32504:21"/>after humble Invocation of the Bleſſing of God, and the aids of his Spirit; compoſeing our minds and thoughts as in his moſt awe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and holy Preſence.</p>
            <p>I have only this farther to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt: that if any one ſoul ſhall find any real Benefit in this kind; he would ſo far requite my chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table aſſiſtance of him, that when his heart is moſt ſerious, his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit moſt compoſed and devout, and his affections moſt vigorous and lively, he would not forget, to put up one Prayer to Heaven for me, for Greater Holineſs and Abilities to Honour God, and perſevering Faithfullneſs to his Truth and Intereſt, what ever Temptations to deſert it may be imploied by the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>Devil:</hi> the three Great Enimies of thine and my Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <p>Of the change in mens Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Opinions, and Actions which one year ſhows.

               </argument>
               <p>WHat a diſcovery doth one year make of the mutability of Man, not only of his outward Condition, but of the Man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, his temper, his Practiſe, his Inclinations, his Averſions, &amp;c. He abideth not at one ſtay: every breath of wind turns him to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhape. We deſpiſe to day, that which we admired yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day: and to morrow hate the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our preſent Love. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin friendſhips, and cancell them
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:32504:26"/>on ſlight occaſions: and a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal enmity often ſucceeds to a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affection; the very Perſons, who are in one year our darling Friends, and poſſibly deſerved to be ſo, may yet be open Enemies the next, and ſeek our Ruine. <hi>Lord! what is man?</hi> How de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull and mutable the Heart of man! we know not what other men are, or will prove to be, till a trial; and we are equally Ignorant concerning our ſelves, till an hour of temptation. How patiently do we think we could bear Afflictions till we feel them! how Partial and miſtaken a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment do we make of our wiſdom and ſtrengh in reference to the future! we counſel others to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and reſignation in the moſt difficult trials, and wonder they complaine ſo loud; when we our ſelves deſpond and ſink under half their Burden: and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:32504:26"/>ſend up our more impatient mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs to Heaven, when God thinks fit to prove us by a lighter Stroke. We cenſure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn others, who are in an higher Station, and are called to more difficult work then we; when by a little Advancement, and the like Temptations, we diſcover that we are as bad as they. They who were reputed Humble Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and Religious, when they have been exalted higher, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Proud, ſenſual, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly. Had ſome been told a twelve moneth ſince, what now they are, and ſpeak, and act, they would have made <hi>Hazael</hi>'s anſwer, <hi>Am I a Dog, that I ſhould do this?</hi> A change in the publick affaires of the State, and by that means of particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſts, or ſome alteration of our own more private Circumſtances (calling us to new Duties and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:32504:27"/>us to new Temptations) diſcovers us more to our ſelvs, and to other men, then was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and proves us to be very different from what we appeared to be. Such a change, for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as from Poverty to Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, from Sickneſs to Health, from obſcurity to Honor, from Privacy to a Publick charge &amp;c. or on the contrary. May we not fear, that ſome, who a year ſince dared not live a day in the neglect of Cloſet and family Devotion, do now omit it, for many Days and weeks together? And that ſome, who once were careful to improve the whole Sabbath to religious purpoſes, now place the whole of their Religion in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the publick worſhip, and think it enough, not for that Day only, but for the whole week. Under the afflicting hand of God, or ſome apprehenſions of an
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:32504:27"/>proaching change, or ſens of Guilt upon Great Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the convictions of ſin are lively, Conſcience is ſenſible and awake, affections warm, Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions ſtrong, &amp;c. but alas! how ſoon doth the caſe alter! our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits cool, our zeal abates, our good Purpoſes untwiſt and dye, and come to nothing. By degrees we return to Folly, and boldly venture on that ſin, we lately trembled at. Thro the want of continued ſmart afflictions, or of a ſerious awakening Miniſtry, and friendly faithfull admonition: or thro the Temptations of vaine Company, and the remaining power of fleſhly Luſts. So that we falſifie our moſt ſacred Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Reſolutions, violate our holy vows, cancell the bonds of God upon us, ſuffer the Devil to reenter and prevail again, to take poſſeſſion of our hearts, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:32504:28"/>yeild our ſelvs an eaſy prey to his Temptations, till our latter end be worſe then our Beginning. Oh what a change doth one year let us ſee! in Perſons as well as things! in our ſelvs as well as other Men! And as it is with Man himſelf, ſo with every thing that he values himſelf upon, or for which he is eſteemed by others: and even this eſteem and Reputation is alſo changeable and uncertaine. Not to Inſtance in Riches, but in what is nobler, <hi>Learning,</hi> and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of the mind by ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; how ſoon may the violence of a Diſeas diſturb or ſtupifie the Braine to that degree, as ſhall reduce the greateſt ſcholar to the Pittied condition of a Fool, or Bedlam? and where is his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and Renown, in ſuch a caſe? But much leſs then that, will blaſt the faireſt Reputation, with the far greateſt part of the world:
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:32504:28"/>it may be loſt by unwary miſtakes, by falſs reports, by envy and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, by the ſubtle hatred of Enemies, or by the weakneſs and credulity of Friends, (who will liſten to every Backbiters ſtory) or by one or two indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the man himſelf; and no man can be certaine to ſecure his Reputation, while he lives: much leſs after he is dead. People will talk of us as they pleaſe: and their opinions very often change from one extreme to the other. But he who hath the loudeſt Fame ſhall only be talkt of a little longer then his Neighbors: and that by a few dying Men, that muſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs be ere long forgotten. And how ſmall a part of the Inhabited world, is acquainted ſo much as with the name of the greateſt men in Europe? and how diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and Contrary are mens Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and Diſcourſes of them,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:32504:29"/>where they are known, and talkt of. And how many holy excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent perſons are buried in obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion, or mis-repreſented as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to live on earth, whoſe names will be found in the book of Life. Our Life is yet as mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and uncertaine as any of thes. Our Breath is in our noſtrils, and tho there be room enough for it to goe out, we have no aſſurance that we ſhall have power to draw it in againe.</p>

Oh let me not defer my neceſſary preparations for Death, which may be nearer then I imagine! let me mind the Great things firſt, which are of abſolute neceſſity, to be done, ſometime or other before I dye! This periſhing Body which I have pamperd and indulged, at the expence of ſo much coſt and Time, may be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifying in a ſilent Grave, before half this year be paſt.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:32504:30"/>no ſhadow leſs ſubſtantial, no ſleep or dream more decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, no ſound more Tranſient, nothing more vaine, and more uncertaine then <hi>Life,</hi> on which all other things in this world de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend. We ſleep every night in the outer chambers of Death: and in ſome diſeaſes, <hi>ſleeps,</hi> which is the image and picture of death is taken away, to give place to the Original, and make way for death. And every year, every week, every day are haſtening to our final change: which may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take us ere we are aware. Every word we ſpeak, is formed of that Breath whereby we live; and we may not live to pronounce ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſentence: but the lamp of life be extinguiſht and blown out by a ſudden blaſt. Every thing we do carries away ſome ſands of our little Glaſs of Time; and how little may remaine? Or how ſoon

When I lye down to ſleep, I hope to riſe ſtronger, and freſher, and fitter for work, but I know with all, I may riſe no more. And may not my name be on the Roll of thoſe who ſhall next be called, at leaſt ſome time this year?

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:32504:32"/>paſſages when they happened, ſeem to be preſent with me: but not knowing what may happen in the ſame number of years to come, I have nothing wheron to fix my thoughts. Or the reaſon of this difference may rather be, that men in this dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and neceſſitous State, (with unſatisfied deſires reaching after Happines, and ſenſible no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing preſent can afford it, and knowing by Experience that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing paſt could have done it,) are eagerly deſirous of Felicity, and becauſe we know not but what is to come may procure it, we hope it will; which makes the Time ſeem long by reaſon of our Expectation and deſire of <hi>Good.</hi> Wheras the foreſight of <hi>Evill,</hi> and the Expectation of <hi>that,</hi> ſome years hence, makes the Time rather ſeem ſhort and near at hand: So many years to come;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:32504:33"/>in the Expectation and deſire of Good, are long and tedious, ſuch <hi>Hope deferred makes the Heart ſick:</hi> even tho 'tis of that, ſort as muſt needs fail our Expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.

This is not the ſtate or ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, wherein, by any promiſe of God, I am encouraged to hope it.

In either of them very little of the great Ends of Life are anſwered. We ordinarily begin to reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our lives from our Birth: wheras for a good while after we know not wither we are alive or no, but are beholding to others to make the account for us. When we firſt come to the ſteady uſe of Reaſon, or what we call the years of Diſcretion; how few are there but from the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:32504:34"/>of Education, from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Humane Nature, from the want of Experience, from the Infection of bad Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, how few, I ſay, but ſpend their younger years in thoſe things, which afterwards they are aſhamed of, when Experience hath taught them the Wiſdom of men. How great a part of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Time is taken up in the neceſſites of Nature about food and Rayment, and in lawfull cares, to ſupport the Body? and how much more then needs, in pampering dreſſing and adorning it? out of the ſmal remainder, how much is imploied in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of a Family, and near Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, in particular Callings, in neceſſary Civil Buſineſs, and in getting, keeping, or impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an Eſtate?

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:32504:35"/>thoughts, journeys, ſickneſs, and innumerable other occaſions, ſome allowable and many needleſs? After this, how little Time remains wherein to Cultivate and improve our minds, by Languages, Arts and Sciences, or the knowledg of a Trade, &amp;c. How little then after all, may we ſay, is left for the the matters of Religion! for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to God, and ſerious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for another world! Alas! how ſmal a number of years make up the Life of Man! and how ſmal a Portion of that, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about the Principal Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for which we were born, &amp; for which we live? We divide Time into Paſt, Preſent, and Future: but the <hi>Paſt</hi> is not now ours; the <hi>Future</hi> is not yet, and the <hi>Preſent now</hi> is paſt, ere the ſound be pronounced And yet this is all the Time alloted us,

In every year there are eight thouſand ſeven hundred ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty five Hours: if we allow the greateſt half for ſleep, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary attendance on the Body, and take but <hi>four thouſand Hours</hi> for our work and buſineſs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence: how poor an acount can moſt men give of all thes four thouſand Hours, in every year? not one hour in <hi>ſeven,</hi> not one in <hi>ten,</hi> is ordinarily devoted to God, and the purpoſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.

As there is no Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to be made with Death; ſo no Agreement for the arreſt and ſtay of Time; it keeps its pace wither I redeem and uſe it well or noe. The greateſt part of our life is deſignedly imploied to av<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oid death, we eat and drink and ſleep and labor and reſt, that we may not dye; and yet even by thes we haſten to death. Every Breath, every puls, every word leaus one leſs of the number which God hath apointed me, and carries away ſome ſands of the glaſs of Time; and yet how little care is taken to imploy it well.

Yea how many complaine of it as a Burden; and

Oh that ſuch a thought might effectually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade me to redeem it! that I may not tarry till the end of Time to know the worth of it, Let me not undervalue it, while 'tis given me to be uſed, that I may not eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally regret my folly, when Time ſhall be no more.</p>

               <p>WHen I conſider the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of another year, I can hardly avoid reflecting on its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts, ſummer and winter, ſpring and fall, and day and night, and their alternate Turns. This calls me to obſerve and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire his Eternal power and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, Wiſdom and Truth, who is the Great Author of this admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable variety. Who hath fixed the Earth with his Foot, and hanged it on nothing, and ſetled the Luminaries of Heaven for Excellent Ends: <hi>The Sun to rule by day, and the Moon by night,</hi> therby to diſtinguiſh Times and Seaſons, to ſeparate Day and Night, Winter and Summer, and conſult the convenience and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:32504:38"/>coin ful of Man and Beaſt by their doe ſucceſſion. <hi>The Day is thine, the Night alſo is thine, thou makeſt Summer and Winter.</hi> How wonderfull is their order, Beauty and conſtant cours! that when the ſun withdraws, and the ſhadows of the Evening cover the Earth with darkneſs, to conclude the <hi>Day;</hi> the Moon and Stars ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the place of the abſent Sun during the <hi>Night:</hi> and that tho they differ in length, yet gradually leſſen till they are both equall at the years end, and have made the ſame circuit. How excellent a work of God is that quick ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to one another. The ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of a <hi>perpetual night,</hi> is a diſmal gloomy thought, O what will the Everlaſting Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Infernal priſon be! The Sun by day inlightens the Earth, directs our motion, gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des our way, governs our Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:32504:39"/>aſſiſts converſation, awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens Induſtry, warms the Earth and Air, gives life, and vigor, and fruitfulneſs to all things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sun, and makes the whole Inferior Creation to rejoice. An Emblem of God's univerſal Goodneſs, who is kind to all his creatures. How admirable is its Luſtre! how glorious is its Light! how loudly doth it proclaim his power and wiſdom! who made this, and the other Lights of Heaven, by his powerful word, and preſerns them hitherto by his daily Providence. If God be now ſo glorious, contemplated in his works, conſidered in the luſtre of the created ſun, viewed only thro the windows of ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ns; how much more glorious will he appear hereafter, when we ſhall ſee him face to face, and nothing interpoſe betwixt us and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Light? If mine Eyes
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:32504:39"/>darle to look upon the meridian Sun, in what inacceſſible Light muſt he dwell, who is <hi>the Father of Lights?</hi> If this lower world, the common receptacle of his Friends and Enemies, have ſo much of his Glory vouchſafed them by the Heavenly Bodies; O what a place will <hi>Heaven</hi> be, where ſhall be no <hi>Sun or Moon</hi> nor need of any, <hi>but the Glory of God ſhall lighten it, and the Lamb be the Light therof.</hi> While I thus conſider the Sun and the Day, I muſt not think the <hi>Night</hi> is uſe leſs: which diſcovers another part of the Heavens, not diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nible by Day, viz the Stars and Planets, refreſhing the Earth, cooling the air, giving neceſſary reſt to the Creatures, &amp;c. their order, motions, aſpects, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, influences, are all uſefull, and Inſtructive. The
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:32504:40"/>agreable mixture of Light and Darkneſs, the regular ſucceſſion of Day and Night within a few hours, are exceeding wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and advantagious. In other parts of the world, where the Sun beams are more direct and its he at exceſſive, God hath made amends by the length of the <hi>night,</hi> (under the Equinoctial line it is allways 12 hours) and in the more northern parts, where the Influence of the Sun is weaker, the <hi>days</hi> are proportionably lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. So good is God to all his Creatures, in all parts of the world! As the morning and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning anſwer to the day of 24 hours, ſo doth Spring and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn to the 12 moneths of the year: that we may not paſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from one extreme to another; but gradually be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for ſo great a change, as is between ſummer and winter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:32504:40"/>winter and ſummer. So mercifull and gracious, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely wiſe is God in all his works! ſo that we cannot ſay, one part of the year is more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary then another. The <hi>winter</hi> is as uſefull for the good of the univerſe, as the <hi>ſummer:</hi> in this we are ſupplied with what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to maintaine us in that, and the admirable ſituation of the Sun, (moſt probably) in the center of the world, ſeems much to contribute to it. If it had been at a farther diſtance from us, our earth would have been in a manner deſolate; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the influence of the ſun could not have been conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and if it had been nearer, the ſtars above would have want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Light, and this Earth in under been burnt up. The Excellent or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which it hath now obeyed for above ſix thouſand years, is alſo
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:32504:41"/>wonderfull. The ſun never ſtood ſtill but once, and that by a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. tho much inferior to that of its daily Progreſs. What a ſubject is here to admire the Power, goodneſs, Wiſdom, and Faithfulneſs of God? <hi>Lord! what is man!</hi> for whom then doſt all this? and becauſe I find every year that the Day dies into night, the ſummer into winter, and herbs and plants loſe their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and verdure, and ſhed their bloſſoms; may I not hence learn to conſider and prepare for my own approaching Change? In proſperity, health, and eaſe, and life, to expect, and make provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for trouble, ſickneſs, paine, and Death? as every wiſe man in ſummer would do for winter; and work with all my might, <hi>while it is called to day,</hi> while the Light continues, becauſe the night of darkneſs is at hand, when none can work.</p>

Should I not ſerve the Lord with more
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:32504:61"/>fervency of Spirit, and be better fortified againſt the Fears of man, who can but hurt and kill the Body, nor that neither, without the permiſſion of God? Should I not order all my affaires, anſwer all Temptations, mortifie in ward Luſts, live in the Exercize of Grace, and in circumſpect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering Obedience, in order to it? Should I not watch more over my Heart, and Lips and Ways, be more diligent to trim my Lamps, more dead to this world, more carefull to call my ſelf fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to an account, to renew my Repentance? Would not my converſe be more uſefull and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, my diſcourſes more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory, and full of Religion, my Prayers to God, more humble and earneſt, my charity to men more unfeigned and extenſive, and my preparations every way more ſuitable to ſuch a Faith, and

               <p>I <hi>May dye this year:</hi> then all my cares and fears, if I am <hi>Rich,</hi> all my ſorrows and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities as to this world, if I am <hi>Poor,</hi> will die too. <hi>I may dye this year:</hi> then I ſhall have no more Enemies, no more ſickneſs, and which is infinitely better, I ſhall ſin no more. <hi>I muſt</hi> ſhortly <hi>dye,</hi> it may be, this year: but there is no other way to come to a Bleſſed Life but by dying, and my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour hath dyed for me, and he that believs in him, ſhall never ſee death: he lives who was once dead, yea he lives for ever more,

Oh what would condemned ſinners in the other world give to be able to believe and ſay ſo of their ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings! <hi>I may dye this year:</hi> and can I wonder that I am ſometimes <hi>Sick,</hi> and in paine, and my Body out of order. Am I not mortal, and dwell in an houſe of clay, which muſt ſhortly moulder into duſt? and is it any thing ſtrange, that ſuch a craſy Building doth ſometimes ſhake, and need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, and threaten a diſſolution? 'Tis a greater wonder, I am any time well. That ſuch a Body, compounded of ſo many little parts, and ſo eaſily diſordered by innumerable accidents, ſhould be in health, is hardly leſs to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, then that an Inſtrument of a thouſand ſtrings ſhould be kept in Tune.

The Great Apoſtle by <hi>dying dayly,</hi> had as many victories over this world, as he lived Days. Oh that I might ſo far walk by the ſame Rule, as every day to think of providing for my laſt! and in health to do that which in ſickneſs I ſhal wiſh I had done!</p>

                  <hi>I may dye this year:</hi> it may be by ſome tedious painful Sickneſs, ſome troubleſome and loathſome Diſeaſe. But God hath promiſed his Grace ſhall be ſufficient: he will make my bed in my ſickneſs: and put under his Everlaſting arms, for my ſupport; and not ſuffer me to be tempted above what I am able: he will increas my Patience and carry me thro the pangs of Death, and the dark valley, and <hi>when Heart and fleſh fail, be the ſtrength of my Heart, and my Portion for Ever.</hi>

Innumerable Chriſtians have dyed by the ſentence of <hi>a Judge,</hi> with more chearfullneſs and Joy, then others, or it may be, then they themſelvs, would have done, by the ſentence of the <hi>Phiſitian.</hi> The Torture of many diſeaſes is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakably more formidable as to the meer paine: and for all the Reſt, the Righteous Lord who loveth Righteouſneſs, will clear my Integrity, if it may beſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his own Great and holy ends: at leaſt he will ſtand by and help me, when all forſake me: and if he ſpeak Peace, and give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Conſolation, who can ſpeak Trouble: and his final Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is near at hand, will diſtribute rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to all, according to their works.</p>

               <p>Suppoſe farther, that I ſhould <hi>want a ſepulcher,</hi> after Death. There is nothing I could better be without. If God receive my Soul, and will raiſe my Body at the laſt day, wither it putrifie and conſume under ground or above it, is no great matter. They who are alive will be more concern'd in that, then I ſhall be; Graves are for the ſake of the Living ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the Dead. The Sun, the Raine, the Air, Birds, Beaſts, Worms, will all contribute to give me Burial, if men deny it. The only difference is, that it will be a little longer ere I am bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. If my ſoul reſt in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of my Saviour, and by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering in the love and practiſe of the Truth, I have ſecured my Reputation with wiſe and Good men, I need not be ſollicituos what become of my Body. My Almighty Judge will raiſe me a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:32504:68"/>glorious Body, like his own, and reunite it to my ſoul? As eaſily, as certainly, as for any of thoſe, whoſe Bodies were preſerved in Caves and Vaults, in Proud Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchers, and under ſtately Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents.</p>

But is not the Everliving God the ſame? cannot he as well take care of them when I am gone, as now? anſwer all my prayers after my deceas? and exerciſe that Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly care, wiſdom, and love, which ſhall diſpoſe of their conditions, ſave them from Temptations, and ſupply all their wants, and exceed all my deſires, in reference to them? and fullfill his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant promiſe from generation to generation, to the Childrens

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:32504:71"/>Allmighty</hi> do not refreſh and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light my ſoul, <hi>they</hi> cannot: and if I want not <hi>theſe</hi> in my laſt ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, no matter in what part or corner of the Earth I breath my laſt, If the word and promiſe of God be my Foundation, an holy Hope my anchor, Chriſt my Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, and Heaven my Country, I ſhall not fail of being landed there at laſt. Suffer me not to forſake thee, <hi>o Heavenly Father!</hi> while I live; and do not thou forſake me, in my laſt Hour; and let it come when and where thou wilt! If my Bleſſed Saviour will receive my departing ſoul at death, I am not ſollicitous in what Country, or part of the Earth it be.</p>
               <p>And that I may not be unwill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the flower of my Age and Time, <hi>in Youth and Strength,</hi> to leave this world; let me think often, that no one age or part of Life is more privileged againſt
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:32504:71"/>the ſtroke of Death then another. If I have done my work betimes, as my deceaſed <hi>Fellow Traveller</hi> had, is it not better to receive the Bleſſed Recompence, then to tarry longer, in a world of ſin and ſuffering, abſent from the Lord? Shall I not thereby eſcape a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Temptations, ſins and ſorrows, which others by living longer are expoſed to. If my Peace be made with God, what ſhould make me willing to live at this diſtance from him? what ſhoul render this world ſo deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, where God is ſo dishonored, where I am ſo often tempted to diſpleas him, and ſo often yeild to ſuch Temptations: and may I not fear leaſt I ſhould fall into ſuch ſcandalous and greivous ſins, that may bring a publick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach on the Goſpell of Chriſt, and ſadden the Hearts of all my Aquaintance who love the Lord
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:32504:72"/>Jeſus in ſincerity. And tho I ſhould maintaine my Integrity, yet in this world my higheſt love and obedience to God, and my ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt communion with him, is but imperfect. How many Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Diverſions do I dayly meet with, that deaden my Heart to Heavenly contemplations and affections? what diſapointments and ſorrow full diſaſters, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me this is not the place of Reſt and Happineſs? what ſmart Afflictions may ſome of my Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions prove? what dangerous ſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res may attend me in the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Portion of my Time? what oppoſition and hatred from men may the ſtedfaſt profeſſing of the Truth, and fidelity to God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe me to? what publick natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal calamities may I have my ſhare in &amp;c.?</p>
               <p>But if I conſider <hi>old Age</hi> it ſelf, which we doe deſire to reach, what
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:32504:72"/>and how many are the Infirmities and Griefs, and troubleſome Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which attend that ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, which dying young will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent? are not moſt men who reach a very great old Age, helpleſs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Pitty? a Burden to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs, and to all about them? And, (which commonly happens,) may I not <hi>then</hi> be as unwilling to dye, as at preſent? as loath then to leave the world as now, tho in a manner it will have left me? for how many old men, paſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of ſenſual Pleaſures, are yet inordinately fond of a longer Life!</p>
               <p>Have I not been told by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, as well as Chriſtians, that 'tis not the length of Time but its improvement, that doth really make a <hi>Long Life?</hi> If I have anfwered the ends for which I were born, 'tis not too ſoon to dye. No man ever miſcarried as
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:32504:73"/>to his Everlaſting Intreſt, becauſe his Life was ſhort, but Evill. He that is prepared for Death, hath lived long enough: and ſhould thank God for a ſpeedy call to the poſſeſſion of that Felicity, which the Holieſt Saints on Earth deſire and breath after. <hi>Gideon</hi> loſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by returning from victory, <hi>while the Sun was yet high.</hi> If I have wrought but a few hours in the vineyard, and done but a little ſervice for my Lord and Maſter; and yet am diſmiſt, and reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, before the Reſt of my Fellow Laborers, ſhall I repine, and think my Lord doth not be friend me? If he hath any farther Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for me, he will prolong my days, and make me diligent, I hope, and contended. Otherwiſe I pray he would make me rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to dye, and make me willing, and <hi>deſirous</hi> to depart this Life. For to be only <hi>content</hi> to dye,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:32504:73"/>that I may be perfectly Holy, and fully Bleſſed, is me thinks too low for a Chriſtian who acts like himſelf, believing the Certainty of his anowed Principles and Hopes, and knowing that <hi>while we are preſent in the Body, we are abſent from the Lord.</hi>

                  <p>The contemplation of our approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching change may aſſiſt us to mortifie the Luſts of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life to cure Ambition, and promote Contentment.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AL that is in the World, ſaith the Apoſtle, is <hi>the Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life.</hi> The duſt and aſhes, of our own mortality duely conſidered and applied, will help to dead and extinguiſh
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:32504:74"/>each of thes. By <hi>Pride of Life,</hi> we lift up our ſelvs againſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and deſpiſe our Maker: by <hi>the luſt of the Fleſh,</hi> we overlove and indulge the body, and ſtudy to gratifie the ſenſual Appetite: by <hi>the luſt of the Eyes,</hi> our Deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res are immoderate after Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and External Goods. The thought of our approaching End hath a tendency to oppoſe and mortifie theſe Luſts: to humble us before God; to take us off from the inordinate love of the Body; and to moderate our paſſions to Earthly Things. It may help us againſt <hi>Pride,</hi> by ſhowing us the infinite diſtance between the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſelf-ſufficient God, and ſuch poor Duſt as we: who are but of yeſterday, and if he up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold us not, and maintaine our ſouls in life, ſhall be laid in the duſt to morrow. It will mind us of his Juſtice againſt <hi>Sin,</hi> the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:32504:74"/>Parent of <hi>Death,</hi> and of all the miſeries of our mortal ſtate; and convince us of our weakneſs to reſiſt his will, or avoid his wrath. As to our fond affection to the Body, it may inſtruct us, that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves not to be ſo much accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of; it will open our eyes to diſcern the preference of our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall ſouls, and what concerns them, to the intereſt of a periſhing Body. It may convince us, that we are cruel and unkind to our very bodies, by overloving them, becauſe we thereby contribute to their Eternal ſufferings: and ſo teach us to love and uſe our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as Servants to our Souls in this world; and as expecting to ſhare in Glory with them, after the Reſurrection. It may alſo help to moderate our deſires after Earthly Good, and ſo cure the <hi>Luſt of the Eyes,</hi> by letting us ſee the vanity, uncertainty, and ſhort
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:32504:75"/>duration of theſe things, and their inſufficiency to make us Happy, and give us true Content.</p>
               <p>The Thoughts of an approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching change may, if any thing will do it, damp the mirth of the <hi>Luxurious Epicure,</hi> and ſtrike him into a fit of trembling, as did <hi>Belſhazzar's</hi> handwriting on the wall. It may diſcover the diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of living in pleaſure, and of care to pleaſe the ſenſes, and the fleſhly appetite, when the End is ſo near. If may likewiſe check the folly of <hi>Ambitious Deſigns:</hi> that men ſhould make ſo much a doe to get into ſlippery places, from whence they may ſo eaſily fall. Where being puft up with vaine applauſe, they forget them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs and their latter end, till their Life, and Glory expire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Where are now the Great, and Mighty, and Honorable, who have made ſuch a noiſe in the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:32504:75"/>world? what is now the difference between the duſt of an <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> or <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and that of their meaneſt ſlaves or Captives? Could their dignities and earthly Glory preſerve any of them, from the ſtroke of Death, or the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, or without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, from his condemning Sentence?</p>
               <p>Think, o my Soul! how little it will ſhortly ſignifie, wither I have been known and honoured among men or no; any farther then God may be glorified by it. How ſhould it ſuppreſs vaine Glory? to think of being one day eſteemed, and worſhipt, reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced, and applauded by dying men, and laid in the Grave the next? Let me rather ſeek that Glory and Honour, to which Immortality is annext: and labor to be accepted with God, at whoſe Bar I muſt be judged, endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:32504:76"/>to keep the teſtimony of a good conſcience: and then it is not much wither I paſs thro good Report or Evill Report: no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, or frowns, or threatnings of men need then diſcourage me. Tho I ſhould be trampled on by the foot of Pride, while others are happy in a dream for a little while; and it may be have a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous paſſage to damnation; I'le rather thank God for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering me from their Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and giving me the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and call, to haſten my Preparations for a Better World. Let God diſpoſe of my Condition here, and Reputation too, as beſt ſhall pleaſe his Sovereign will: only be pleaſed to keep me upright, and to preſerve me from Everlaſting ſhame and confuſion of Face, after the general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and final Judgment! vouchſafe me a portion now in
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:32504:76"/>thine approving love, and own me for Thine at laſt, in the Great and Terrible Day of Reckoning; that then I may hear the Bleſſed <hi>Euge,</hi> and enter into my Lords Joy!</p>

Tho I know beſides my own mortality, that to inforce the argument, there is a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Corruption in all theſe things; that our very Manna here in a little while will ſtink, and Bread, which is the ſtaff of Life, moulder, our richeſt garments wax old and rot, ſilver and gold ruſt, and the greateſt Beauty wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and every thing that is Earthly decay and periſh. And ſhall not this teach me to ſit looſe from all ſuch Things? Can I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that in my laſt hour it will be eaſier to part with much, then little? or better in the day of Judgment to have a great Eſtate
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:32504:78"/>to anſwer for then a leſſer one? We read concerning the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch <hi>Abraham,</hi> (who rightly underſtood the tranſitory nature of riches, and his own mutable Condition,) that the only <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe</hi> he made with his riches, was a <hi>Grave:</hi> chooſing to take poſſeſſion of the land promiſed him, rather by a mark of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with it, then of his Poſſeſſing it. Did I think oftner and more ſeriouſly, <hi>o my Soul!</hi> of tarrying here but a littte while; I ſhould more eaſily be perſuaded, that a little of this world were ſufficient to carry me thro it. I ſhould conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der more that my <hi>Heavenborn</hi> ſoul is made and deſigned for another, an endleſs World; and therefore ſhould not ſo far <hi>forget his own People,</hi> and <hi>Fathers houſe,</hi> as eagerly to purſue and ſeek what is ſuited only to the Body, for a little while, and whereof a little
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:32504:78"/>with Contentment will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
               <p>The ſame Reflexion may be uſefull to contract our Thoughts to preſent duty; that we may not perplex our minds with long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and projects; which if we dye this year, will come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Our great Buſineſs in this world is adapted to the little por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Time, which is allowed us. Not that good Deſigns for the publick Benefit, may not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by one, and finiſht by others: or that we are not obliged pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to provide for thoſe who ſhall come after us, by attempting many Things of probable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to Poſterity.

               </argument>
               <p>IN this world we begin a Year, and quickly come to the end of it; and ere long the little number of our years, and days, will be expired. But when death conveys us into the World of Spirits, the day of Eternity ſhall never be cloſed with an Evening. Of how fearfull conſequence is that <hi>Death,</hi> by which an <hi>Eternity</hi> muſt be decided! What atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what ſeriouſneſs, what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, what care, doth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of ſo important a matter
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:32504:80"/>call for! ETERNAL! what will be the next word, o my ſoul! how much am I concerned to know it! will it be Bleſſedneſs, or Miſery? will it be Life or Death? This one word is the Joy of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and the Horror of Devils; the unſpeakable Delight of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saints, and the confuſion and Deſpair of condemned Sinners.</p>
               <p>At the Creation of the World, <hi>Time</hi> got the ſtart of us, and was five days elder then we: but our Immortal Souls ſhall indure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the utmoſt limits of Time, and laſt as long as the Everlaſting Father of Spirits, of whoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration there is no end. Shall I then exiſt and live, tho my Body periſh and ſee corruption? Shall my ſoul, my ſelf exiſt beyond the Grave, in Felicity or Miſery, and that for ever and according to my preſent Actions? what am I then moſt concerned to mind?
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:32504:80"/>what am I to chooſe? What am I moſt to fear, to wiſh, to do? What is a ſhadow of honor and reputation among dying men? What are a few drops of fleſhly Pleaſure for a moment, to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Rivers of Pleaſure, at God's right hand? What are the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of an hour or two, to the pains and anguiſh of Eternity? What can the World, Fleſh, or Devil give me, comparable to Eternal Life? What can I ſuffer in the way of Holineſs, that may be ſet in the balance againſt an Everlaſting Hell? And yet how often, o my ſoul! how boldly, how unconcernedly, how foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly, do I hazard the one, and forfeit the other, for the ſins and vanities of this world! Whereas one proſpect of <hi>Eternity</hi> ſhould make every thing that is Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral appear little in my eyes: the higheſt elevation of earthly
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:32504:81"/>Greatneſs, abundance of Riches the great Affaires, Buſineſs, and Imployments of the World, Pomp, and Splendor, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and all that now flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the ſenſes, and the vanity of Mankind.</p>
               <p>Oh that I could but live as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving and expecting <hi>an Eternal State!</hi> as having it in my Eye, managing all my affaires with a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible reference to it: diſcovering to all the world by my Behaviour and Deportment, that I doe in earneſt believe it certaine? for be it never ſo <hi>Certaine,</hi> if I do not apprehend, and conſider it as ſuch, it will no more affect me then a Fable. Neither is it enough to conſider it as certaine, but as <hi>Near:</hi> for the moſt weighty, the moſt terrible things, apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as at a great diſtance, will little move. Thinking of the long In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval between, the advantage of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:32504:81"/>being exempted from ſuch evills for ſo long a time, will pleaſe me more, then ſuch diſtant Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will affright.</p>
               <p>Let me therefore indeavor to impreſs the conſideration of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity</hi> at hand, more deeply on my heart: that I may walk, and live, diſcours, and pray, and demean my ſelf in every thing, as near an unchangeable State. Am I not convinc't that this is Certaine, from the nature and operations of my ſoul, from the reflexions of Conſcience, from the Righteouſneſs of God, in his Government of the world, from the preſent unequal Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Good and Evill by his Providence, and from the plaine and frequent aſſertions of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Will? I have nothing to object, nothing to reply; but I find a neceſſity of inculcating and urging the conſideration of it in
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:32504:82"/>order to its influence. I find it needfull to reflect often, how near I am to ſuch an Endleſs State: that in one Inſtant, by Death, I enter upon it: and that this inſtant may be as near me, as my next Thought. That the H. Scripture deſcribes the two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Conditions after death, (and every man and woman in the world ſhall ſhare in one of them) as both Everlaſting: the one, by <hi>Eternal Life, Eternal Glory, an incorruptible Crown, that fadeth not away, an incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Inheritance, an Houſe Eternal in the Heavens, &amp;c.</hi> the other, <hi>by unquenchable Fire, a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whence no eſcape, Eternal Damnation, Everlaſting Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, everlaſting Puniſhment, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Deſtruction, a worm that never dies, wrath that is ever to come, blackneſs of darkneſs for ever, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Think, o my Soul! that in one of theſe two contrary States, I muſt abide for ever.

               <p>Is this an unqueſtionable Truth? O let me conſider it, till I feel the power and efficacy of ſo important a Principle! let the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion be deep and laſting! let it peirce and enter into my very ſoul! to cool the heats of luſt, to quench ſenſual and earthly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and to mortifie all in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

               <p>Lord! cure the unbelieving doubts concerning theſe Great things, which notwithſtanding the plaineſt Evidence, the Devil may at any time ſuggeſt! let a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed

               <p>Oh that I might now feel more of this Heavenly Life begun, and carried on in my ſoul, by a farther participation of his holy Image, and conformity to his will! by more vital effects of his indwelling Spirit, in my ſoul, forming it to be a Temple to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for his own delightfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence! that forgetting that, which I have received, I may ſtill be Covetous and deſirous of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re: forgetting what I have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, I may preſs on with an holy Eagerneſs and Fervency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the mark!</p>
               <p>When I ſeriouſly examine my
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:32504:96"/>own heart, had I nothing els to prove the weakneſs of my Grace, &amp; the ſinfull remainders of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, but the low deſires, and few confortable Thoughts, the ſeldom joyfull proſpect of this Bleſſed State, how ſad an Evidence were it? that I breath with no more Impatience, after that Bleſſed holy Reſt, in the injoyment of God and Chriſt; and labor no more in preparing for it? when all the Deſires of our Souls ſhall be fix't on Him, and filled with him, as our Infinite and ſupreme Good: and all the Expectations of Faith and Hope, ſwallowed up in endleſs admiration, grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and Joy: being fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and at Reſt, in the Preſence and viſion of God; without the leaſt Inclination or Deſire of change. And by conſequence,</p>
               <p>There will be no need of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty,</hi> as now, to give a reliſh to
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:32504:97"/>our Happineſs. All Happineſs in this world is by comparing a man's preſent Condition, with his paſt, or with that of ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors. But the Intrinſick Good, Felicity, and Joy of Heaven, will need no ſuch foile to ſet it off; no ſuch compariſon to make it prized. The Bleſſed Spirits will never loſe the lively ſenſe of that low and miſerable Condition, from which they were raiſed to ſo great a Glory: and ſo will ever equally rejoyce in the Happineſs of their Tranſlation and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full change. And what was at firſt delightfull, will for ever be ſo; and not be diſdain'd or leſſen'd by a continuance: as it happens in this world, from the Emptineſs, ſhallowneſs, and vanity of the Creature. An Affectation of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, and deſire of change, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding allways from a ſenſe of want. But Holy Souls ſhall never
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:32504:97"/>be weary of ſeeing, loving, and injoying God; his bleſſed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence will afford us undecaying, and endleſs ſatisfaction: Pleaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, never to be interrupted, or abated, and never to ceas. The bleſſed object is abſolutely Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and ſo will be allways <hi>new</hi> to a finite underſtanding, and continual freſh Communications from his infinite fullneſs, muſt needs make our ſubjective Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to be allways <hi>new,</hi> &amp; Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally So.</p>
               <p>Let me by ſuch Thoughts quicken and excite my diligent endeavors, after a greater meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to injoy ſo Great a Bliſs. And to that end conſider whither any of thoſe happy ſouls, who have finiſht their courſe, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Prize, do now regret their utmoſt diligence, patience. and perſeverance, during their ſhort abode here, to ſecure the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:32504:98"/>Bleſſedneſs of an Endleſs Life, <hi>No, no,</hi> they are far from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting the Time they ſpent, the trouble they were at, the care they uſed, the difficulties they met with, the ſufferings they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured: to conflict with the world, and the fleſh, to reſiſt temptation, to watch over their Hearts, and words, and ways, to work out their Salvation, to pleaſe God, and be faithfull to him, &amp;c. They find to their unſpeakable comfort, and Everlaſting Joy, that <hi>Heaven</hi> makes amends for all they could do or ſuffer in order to their coming thither. Yea they find, that they were not diligent, and humble, and patient, and circumſpect enough. That they did not love God, and ſeek his glory, redeem their Time, and improve all their Talents and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of doing and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving good, and give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:32504:98"/>intirely to prepare for Heaven, to that degree, they ſhould have done. They find, by the tranſcendency of the Bleſſed Recompence, that it deſerved infinitely more then the moſt active zealous Chriſtian upon earth did ever do, in order to it.</p>

               <p>But alas! how much have I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected the great Duty of Holy meditation? how little skill and experience have I in it, how taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and inſipid oftentimes are my

Yet methinks, could I but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the ſame awakened lively thoughts of Heaven, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, which ſometimes I have had; might I continually feel the ſweet and ſacred Influence as for a little ſeaſon I have ſometi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes felt it; how little, how very a Nothing, would all <hi>this world</hi> be to me! how comparatively weak, its ſtrongeſt and moſt all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uring ſnares, to draw me off from.

               <p>Could I maintaine ſuch a frame of Spirit, as I have ſometimes had for a little while; in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:32504:99"/>contemplation of divine myſteries, in fervent Prayer, and other ſolemn duties of Religion; when the acts of Faith were ſtrong and lively, my heart ſet on fire with love to God, and holy brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things after him, admiring his matchleſs Grace to fallen Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; (and to my Soul in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar:) when he brought me to the very ſuburbs of Heaven, (tho alas! how ſeldom,) by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull Thought of what the Bleſſed Spirits above injoy; in being where Chriſt is, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding his Glory: when I was ready to ſay within my ſelf, <hi>'Tis good to be Here: this is no other then the gate of Heaven; Oh when ſhall Mortality be ſwallowed up of Life!</hi> But when I thought at any time to fix and ſettle in ſuch ſweet Contemplations, how quickly did my lazy backward
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:32504:100"/>Heart flye off! how ſoon did the flame decay, and dye away! how ſoon did I find my ſelf fallen down to Earth againe! ſunk down from the boſome of my Lord, preſently forgot my ſelf, and Heaven, to dwell among the Pots, and imbrace a dunghill! 'Twas not on my own wings, o Lord! that I ſoared ſo high: but I hope, by the breathings of that H. Spirit of Light and Love, who bloweth when, and where, and how long he liſteth. Who gave me at any time any ſuch <hi>firſt fruits of the Spirit;</hi> who convinc't me of the Certainty of the Heavenly Inheritance, by a lively believing foreſight of it; who made me earneſtly deſire the wings of a Dove to be gone, and appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in Sion; made me pant, and groan to be delivered, and to be with God, and Chriſt, with
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:32504:100"/>inexpreſſible deſire and joy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivably mixt together with ſighs and Groans. O my God! let not this experience be only ſuch a Taſte of the Powers of the world to come, as is conſiſtent with final Apoſtacy! only the ſeeming zeal of the ſtony ground! the rapturous Joy of an hypocrite! from the power of Imagination, and an heated Fancy; from the workings of meer natural ſelf love; upon miſtaken apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of God, and a fals Opinion of Heaven! but by the holy ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, let me be aſſured of the cauſe and Principle; that it was of God!</p>
               <p>Teach me from the ſweetneſs of a Spiritual Communion with God now in any of his apointed Ordinances, to argue to my ſelf what that moſt raviſhing ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction will be, that the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:32504:101"/>of God in Heaven will afford the ſoul. Our Holineſs is now imperfect, to what it ſhall be: and therefore our Conſolation, Peace, and Joy, is but in part, and incomparably leſs then we are aſſured it will be, when we ſhall be admitted to behold the Glory of the Lord. 'Tis now at moſt but as the Break of Day, to the luſtre of the. Meridian Sun. But if in this low imperfect State, we can ſometimes obtaine ſo near a view of his Glory, and feel ſuch ſweet communications of his Grace; how much more of this conſolation and Joy is reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to Heaven? If in this Pilgrim ſtate, the gifts and graces, and comforts of the H. Spirit are ſo refreſhing; O what hath God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared beyond the Grave, for thoſe who love him! If now he ſometimes ſhed abroad his love in
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:32504:101"/>our Hearts, after ſuch a manner; how much better ſhall I love him, and feel the influence, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his Love to me, when I ſhall be with him, and ſee him face to face? If the apprehenſions of this future Bleſſedneſs, do now encourage, raiſe, and animate my drooping ſoul; O what ſhall I know, and ſee, and how ſhall I rejoyce when the vail is removed! If a Sacramental Communion with God and J. Chriſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo ſweet, and ſo affecting; what will the Bleſſed Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, and all his Saints above amount to! when I ſhall ſit down with all the Children of God, in the Preſence of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degroom, at the laſt Great Supper of the Lamb in Glory! If the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of our Inheritance be ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving, what will be the ful Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it! If the Hopes of that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:32504:102"/>glorious day, by holy medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be ſo tranſporting; what will be the end of our Faith and Hope? If a Grape or two in the Wilderneſs, be ſuch a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall; what will be the whole vintage in the Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe!</p>
               <p>Shall I after all this forget my own Experience, and run from God and Heaven, to imbrace or ſeek a periſhing Toy? Shall I hide my ſelf, with <hi>Saul,</hi> among the ſtuff, and lumber of this world, when God is calling me to a Glorious Crown? Art thou, o my Soul! a Kings Son, an Heir of Heaven, an expectant of ſuch Great Felicity; and yet ſtoop ſo low? Hope for Heaven; and yet graſp this Earth, and hugg the vaine Appearances of Earthly Good? Hope to be <hi>like to God:</hi> (and oh how Glorious an Hope
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:32504:102"/>is that!) to pertake of his Image, and live Eternally with him; and yet be ſollicitous, anxious, and diſquieted about Honor, and money, and a Tempora! Intereſt? and mightily concerned about the momentany gratifications of the Fleſh, and the Injoyments of this World? Art thou a Pilgrim, and Stranger here; and travelling home to the Heavenly Country, and yet Eager and paſſionate about Earthly Things? Should an Heart, that is ſet upon Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, (or may be ſo, and ought to be ſo,) ſhould it burn with ſuch kitchin, ſuch common Fire? and neglect the unconceivable Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and Pleaſures, and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Honors of the other Life? and the dawnings of that Glory upon my ſoul, by the foretaſts of it in this? Should I not live, as ſeeking ſuch things? as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting ſuch a Glory? And are
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:32504:103"/>careleſs and indifferent thoughts, ſleepy heartleſs prayers, faint and weak indeavors, becoming in ſuch a caſe? Shall I not mend my pace, and double my diligence in my preparatory work? When I can believingly foreſee the Bleſſed Recompence; Wayting for that Everlaſting Light of the Sun of Righteouſnes, which no Ecclipſe ſhall ever darken or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure; for that Eternal Glorious Day, which ſhall never be cloſed with an Evening. When I ſhall ſee the face of God, in Chriſt, and be like him, participate more of his image, reſt in his love, and dwell for ever in the light of his Countenance: according to the Prayer and Promiſe of my Bleſſed Saviour. And ought not ſuch a proſpect to ſweeten the Bitterneſs of all our intermediate ſufferings? we are now oftentimes in heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſorrow; but Eternity
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:32504:103"/>will be enough for an interrupted Joy. When we ſhall exchange all our troubles for Everlaſting Reſt; our priſons for perfect liberty; our Poverty for the Riches of God; darkneſs for Light; diſcord for love; deformity for beauty, our weakneſſes, and preſent lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhings, for ſtrength and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor; folly for wiſdom; diſgrace for Glory; ſickneſs and paine for Eternal Eaſe and Health; the Animal for the Angelical Life; imperfection and pollution for conſummate Holineſs; our Sighs, and Tears, and Sorrows, and complaints, for triumphant E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Praiſe; our loſſes, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts, diſapointments, perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xities, fears, groans, and Death, for crowns and ſcepters, hymns and Hallelujahs, light, and life, and Bliſs unutterable; and ſuch great things, as are fit for us to hope, but too Great to be now

                  <p>The Glorious Appearance of Chriſt to Judgment conſidered as Certaine: the Terror, and Aſtoniſhment, Confuſion, and Deſpair of the Wicked, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold their Judge; and hear his condemning Sentence to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERLASTING Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHen our Bleſſed Saviour ſhall appear to judge the world, I read that it ſhall be, <hi>in his own Glory, the Glory of his Father, and of the Holy Angels.</hi> If by the <hi>glory of his Father,</hi> be meant that of the Divinity, as the Original and Author of all things in nature, as Creator of the World: and by the <hi>Glory of his holy Angels,</hi> be underſtood that of the Legal adminiſtration: the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:32504:111"/>Law being given by the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Angels: and by <hi>his own Glory,</hi> that of the Goſpel, as he is the Meſſiah: that in the Glory of all theſe, he ſhall come to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we have a ſummary account of the three different Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. which God hath made of himſelf to mankind; by the Light of <hi>Nature,</hi> that of the <hi>Law,</hi> and the more manifeſt one of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> According to which every man is to be judged at the laſt day.</p>
               <p>Tho we cannot diſtinctly tell what or how great our Lord's Glory will then be; we may be certaine, it will be ſuitable to the dignity of his Royal perſon: ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the grandeur of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Majeſty: with the ſplendor of a Triumphant Prince, who is Heir of all Things, and hath all power in Heaven and in Earth committed to him, the Great
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:32504:112"/>Lord of both Worlds, Head of Angels an men: and ſuitable to his glorious office, as Mediator, and the apointed Judge of Quick and Dead.</p>
               <p>If at his Transfiguration his Face ſhone, and his Rayment was white and glittering, how much more ſplendid will his laſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance be? When the Bodies of his Saints ſhall be ſeven times brighter then the luſtre of the Sun? and if his Members ſhall then be ſo glorious, how tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendently more ſo will their Head, their Lord appear? If the delivery and promulgation of the Law, on Mount Sinai, was accompanied with ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of terrible Majeſty, how much more may we ſuppoſe the <hi>Great Aſſize</hi> will be attended with? When he comes to judge for the violation of the Law, and the contempt of the Goſpel. And
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:32504:112"/>if even <hi>Moſes</hi> did then exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly quake and fear, what will be the conſternation and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of the wicked World at the Coming of Chriſt? <hi>When he ſhall be revealed from Heaven, in fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Fire,</hi> with a glorious reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of his mighty <hi>Angels,</hi> as ſo many bright Stars about the more glorious Sun of Rightouſneſs. The lights of Heaven ſhall be Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſt: the viſible Sun ſhall vail its bluſhing head as infinitely out ſhone: the preſent glory of the Creation be all benighted, by reaſon of his tranſcendent Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Yea the Heavens ſhall be wrapt up as a ſcrol; the Elements melt away with a mighty noiſe; the Earth and all its works be burnt up; and the whole univerſe as one great Bonefire, to adorn the Triumph of our Lords Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. And this uſhered in by the voice of an Archangel, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming

               <p>Thus in triumph, as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror and a Judge, ſhall he come againe, who once appear'd in the form of a Servant to be judged and condemn'd by Man. <hi>Then</hi> he was called <hi>King</hi> in ſcorn: <hi>now</hi> he will appear as much above all Earthly and Humane Greatneſs, as once he ſtoopt for our ſakes beneath it. <hi>Then</hi> the Contempt of Nations, and no way eſteem'd Deſireable, when he came from the womb of his Virgin-Mother: <hi>now</hi> the Terror of the World, when he comes againe from the right hand of his Father.

               <p>How confortable is the news of it? how joyfull will be the mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, to ſuch as expect and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to ſee him?

But who can expreſs how diſmal a Sight this will be to the ſecure and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent, to all who dye in their Sins? to behold their <hi>Judge,</hi> (who formerly offered to be their <hi>Saviour,</hi>) upon a glorious Thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and all the Children of Adam
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:32504:114"/>ſummon'd to his Tribunal! to have nothing to anſwer againſt his charge, and no way to eſcape his condemning ſentence! they deſpiſed him as <hi>a Lamb,</hi> offer'd in Sacrifice, to take away the ſins of the World: but ſhall no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger do ſo, when he comes as the <hi>Lion</hi> of the tribe of Juda, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and deſtroy the Enemies of his Croſſe. Now, they will not own him for their <hi>Lord;</hi> but ſhall then find he is ſo, by the vengeance he will execute.

He who by his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors doth now intreat Sinners to be reconciled; will then be as deaf to their Intreaties, as they have been to his. Becauſe they
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:32504:115"/>would not turn at his Reproof hearken to the call of his word and obey its voice, they muſt hear the ſentence of Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and feel the Execution of it, wither they will or no. Yea the bloud of his Croſſe will up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid, accuſe, and plead againſt them. And what ever fooliſh Evaſions they now make, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in ſecurity, they ſhall then be ſpeechleſs and ſelf-condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.

The Greateſt, the Stouteſt, the boldeſt of them ſhall then be humbled, and ſtand before Chriſt's Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, upon an equal Level with the meaneſt: ſeized with horror,

Is it not worth conſidering, wither I muſt goe, and how I ſhall fare, when I quit this Body? what is like to be my next Habitation? to which of the two unchangeable States I ſhall be adjudg'd? Shall an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry of ſo much conſequence be put off to an indefinite Hereafter? do I not deſire to know the worſt, while a remedy may be found? or am I content to dye, thro an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs to diſcover that I am Sick? The queſtion to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved is of infinite weight. Shall I not ſpend a few hours to know what will become of me <hi>for ever?</hi> An error is more then poſſible, 't is eaſy to miſtake: and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of doing ſo is unſpeakably great.

Is it Heaven or Hell I muſt be tranſlated to by Dyeing? what Security have I got for Eternal Life? what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions have I made? what foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation have I laid?</p>
               <p>How ſtrangely infatuated are moſt men, who talk of an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life as an Article of their Creed; and ſay they count upon it, that they muſt dwell in Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs or Miſery for ever; and that ſeldom or never bethink themſelvs in good earneſt, and for any Time, with a ſetled compoſed exercize of Thoughts, Which of theſe Two is like to
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:32504:127"/>be their Lot. Or If they begin to ſearch and try themſelvs, they come to no Concluſion, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude too haſtily: they pluk off the plaiſter, aſſoon as it begins to ſmart; they are either frighted with the horrid proſpect of paſt Crimes, or, haveing eſcap't the groſſer Pollutions of the world, judge too favourably of their own caſe. They commonly do the work but by halves, and ſo goe from the glaſs and forget what manner of perſons they were.</p>
               <p>Let me therfore, o my Soul: Sequeſter my ſelf from the world, to commune with my own heart to reflect upon my paſt Life, and look in to my preſent ſtrate, to recollect and review the moſt conſiderable paſſages of my courſe and Time hitherto. O how neglected and diſuſed a Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe is this! which doth challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:32504:128"/>and require our principal and moſt Serious concern about it, and how many begin it and are diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, and leave off without reaching the End of ſuch an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.</p>
               <p>How much wiſer, in this reſpect, are the Children of this world, in their Generation, then the Children of Light? who is ſo Exact in his accounts between God and his own Soul, as Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des-men in their dealings with one another? who is at the pains to write down his Sins and his Mercies? the grounds of his Fear, and the encouragements of his Hope? or keeps a Journal and Diary of his Spiritual State? who doth at ſet times, once a moneth, or once a Quarter, or even once a year, take a juſt view of him ſelf, his Heart, and Life, and State, as a Chriſtian? that he may ſee what he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:32504:128"/>and done; what he owes, and what he may expect: that he may know wither he thrive or decay; wither be increaſe or decreaſe, wither he goe backward or forward; wither he be Richer or Poorer, <hi>this year</hi> then the <hi>laſt:</hi> And is it not a ſymptom that you are declining, when you love not to examine your Accounts? Is there not ground of Jealouſie and Suſpicion, that you are behind hand, becauſe you are loath to inquire, whither you are or no? and unwilling to know the worſt of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Nevertheleſs, without Such Enquiries, and bringing the matter to a determination, at what uncertainties muſt we live? and how unconceivable an haſzard do all Hypocrites and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renewed Sinners run? and how reaſonable, how neceſſary is it that we ſhould know, and in order
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:32504:129"/>to it, prove our ſelves? we muſt therfore beſtow Time and ſerious Diligence about it, that we may examine matters to the bottom, and come to ſome Reſult, that we may form a right Judgment concerning our own caſe.</p>
               <p>He that would do it to good purpoſe, muſt endeavor to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand cleerly the terms of the Covenant on God's part, and on ours: and take care not to Judge of himſelf by, miſtaken rules; by a falſe Standard, that God will not juſtifie; or by any, ſuch characters as will not conclude. But moſt men are unwilling to bring themſelves to a Trial, or let Conſcience deal plainly and faithfully with them. They are ſtupidly ſecure, and ſee not the neceſſity of this duty. Or do not ſuſpect themſelus. They preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me they need not be at that Trouble: or are ſo taken up with
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:32504:129"/>the World, that they cannot find Time and leaſure <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>r it. And many men dare not bring their Hearts and ways to a Trial. There is commonly ſome ſeeret Luſt indulg'd, which they are loath to let goe. But moſt goe on in ſin, and periſh Eternally, becauſe they think there is no danger of periſhing: and never repent, and make their Peace with God, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/> cauſe they fancy and preſume tis done allready.</p>
               <p>Therfore let me beg of thee, who ever thou art, who readeſt this, to put the caſe to thy ſelf ſeriouſly to admit the doubt, wither you are not miſtaken; make the ſuppoſition, tho you have not hitherto ſufficiently conſidered the State of your Soul. You are confident that <hi>all is wel;</hi> and therupon are unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to examine farther: but for that very reaſon you ought to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:32504:130"/>queſtion, whither it be ſo or not? do but ask your ſelf ſeriouſly, what is the ground of your good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concerning your ſelf? for what reaſon can you thus conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de?</p>
               <p>Did you ever ſeriouſly lay to heart the Characters and deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the Scriptures give, of thoſe whom Chriſt will own, at the laſt day, and of ſuch whom he will reject and reprobate? with unfeigned application to your own caſe, have you therwith prov'd your ſelves? and come to a ſetled Judgment, after a deli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>berate Enquiry? And was the Concluſion to your comfort, and Joy? If ſo, what influence hath it ſince had upon your Heart and Life? hath it promoted Purity, Thank fullneſs, Heavenly-min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedneſs: contempt of this world, and ſtronger Deſires after the Image, love, and preſence of
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:32504:130"/>God, and the Glory of Chriſt? Moreover, conſider.</p>
               <p>Is it not this a good while a goe? how have you behav'd your ſelf ever ſince? have you not reaſon to look back with ſhame? If you but ſlightly examin'd your ſelf formerly, reſolve to do it more effectually now: review the ſins you have been ſince Guilty of. And if you have not done any thing conſiderable of this kind, you ought now to begin. It is ſeaſonable to begin the year by ſuch an Exerciſe, and it will be found of great uſe, in all the following parts of it: eſpecially when you come to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine your ſelf afreſh, in order to the Lord's Supper. For we ought frequently to renew the ſad remembrance of our former Sins, that from time to time we may renew our Repentance, which is the work of our Life, and not
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:32504:131"/>of one day. And he that comes to the Sacrament, and will look no farther back, then to the laſt Communion, may poſſibly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume too much, that all was then as it ſhould be, and not be humble enough.</p>
               <p>If any one therfore reſolve in good earneſt up on an holy Life, and ſeriouſly deſign to prepare for Eternity, as it is neceſſary to make a general review of his Life, ſo I deſire to afford him the beſt Counſell I can, in order to it</p>

               <p>Conſider the Opportunities and ſolemn Occaſions of approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the divine Preſence: Are they as much the Deſire of your ſouls, and the rejoycing of your Hearts as once they were?

Doe you hunger and thirſt, and pant as the Hart after the water brooks, to draw nigh to God, and come into his Courts?
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:32504:139"/>doe you make Conſcience of preparing before hand? do you come with a real deſire, and deſign, and expectation of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting, and bettering your Spirits? do you joyn in every part of divine worſhip, with that attention, ſeriousneſs, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure of mind, and taſte the ſweetneſs and benefit of ſuch ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities, as formerly? are ſuch ſervices performed with that Awe of God, with that Humility, Fervency, and Intenſneſs of Spirit, as ſome times they were? are you not more Negligent and unconcern'd before and after, wither you find any thing of this or no? your Deſires weak, your Hearts flat, your Thoughts wandring, your Spirits trifling? ſo the work be done, and the duty be over, (in how formal, cuſtomary, and careleſs a manner, ſoever it be,) you
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:32504:139"/>conſider it not, you lay it not to Heart, you reflect not upon it, you bewail it not, or at leaſt are better contented and ſooner quieted, and take leſs notice of the frame of your Heart in ſuch Duties then formerly?</p>
               <p>Examine farther how 'tis with you as to the great diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſing Duties of an upright Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, (if performed as they ought to be,) I mean <hi>Secret Pra er and meditation:</hi> Are you as ſtrict and carefull, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and Conſcientious, frequent and abundant in theſe, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly? may not our Cloſets and places of Retirement witneſs againſt us? our former humble and importunate Prayers joyfull Thanksgivings, and ſweet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the Myſteries of Religion, compared with our preſent dayly practice, will teſtifie that we are declin'd and fallen.</p>

               <p>Moreover conſider <hi>the Evil of Sin,</hi> and how your Heart ſtands affected to it.

Doe you bewail it, ſhire againſt it, and ſhun the occaſions, and fear the Temptations, that may lead you unto Sin, as once you did? Have you not loſt much of that tenderneſs and holy Jealouſy over your heart and ways, you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had? Doe you not now make more bold with Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Are you not of oftner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered? and with leſs Reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce? and by ſmall Temptations &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Are you not more Unſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable? Root and Fruit in a withering condition? God leſs

Make a pauſe a while and bethink your ſelf what this will come to at laſt? even the little Good that remains is ready to dye.</p>
               <p>May I not ask ſuch Chriſtians, or deſire them to ask themſelves, what is all ready the effect and conſequence of this declenſion? Is not God's Spirit removed, and the Light of his Countenance Ecclipſt? yea as to many of them, are they not under Sad apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of God's diſpleaſure? do they not feel the terrors of the Lord? do they not walk heavily from day to day? they that could
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:32504:141"/>once converſe with God on all occaſions as a Friend, and a Father, do now think of God and are troubled: thick Darkneſs doth incompaſs them round about: they have loſt the ſence of his Love, the comforts of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and their Song in the night, and ſee no relief. This is a more hopefull caſe however, then theirs, who are under great Backſlidings and Deſertion, and hardly ſenſible of it. To awaken and affiſt both, Conſider I beſeech you, whence you are fallen, and what you have loſt, and what will be the iſsue of this, if Sickneſs, or ſome ſmart Affliction overtake you, or if you ſhould dye in this condition. And inquire ſeriouſly, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, into the cauſe of all this Evil: for a few tranſient thoughts will not affect the Heart and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade to Action. And do it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:32504:141"/>becauſe by every delay your work will be the harder, your danger the greater, and your Recovery the more difficult. Reflect upon the <hi>Sinfullneſs</hi> as well as Affliction of this caſe: know you have diſpleaſed God, and run from him, neglected his Preſence, and griev'd his Spirit, and in what Inſtances you have done ſo; that have made him weary of his dwelling: what Ordinances you have ſlighted; what Duties you have omitted; what ſins you have given way to; in order to Repentance and deep Humiliation.</p>
               <p>Can you contentedly ſit ſtill, with this dismal State of Things? while <hi>God hath ſomewhat</hi> (yea a great deal indeed,) <hi>againſt you, for having left your firſt Love?</hi> will you not endeavor to remove that which hath made ſuch a ſeparation between God
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:32504:142"/>and you, and brought you thus low? what Communion with, God, what communications of his Grace, what influences of his Spirit, and Evidences of his favor have you loſt? and will you not acknowledg your Iniquity, and abaſe your ſelves in the Duſt, and return to the Lord, and doe your firſt works? that he may heal your Backſlidings, and receive you graciouſly; that you may againe take hold of his Covenant, and be at Peace with him.</p>
               <p>But to be <hi>at Peace</hi> with God, is not the whole of your Concern, you need not only a Pardon, but a Phyſitian to heal you; as doth a Malefactor, that is not only lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Law, but deſperately ſick. Your State is ſinfull and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, as well as troubleſome. From performing duties in ſuch a manner as you now do, you
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:32504:142"/>may quickly be Tempted to let them altogether alone. God may be ſo far provok't to ſuffer Satan to make attempts upon you of that kind: and he is forward enough to make uſe of ſuch an opportunity, to try all his Snares and Stratagems againſt you: till he prevail with you, to think hardly of God himſelf, <note place="margin">Vid.

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:32504:148"/>but how little have I done towards it? had I dyed this laſt year, how unprepar'd muſt I have made my Appearance befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re his Tribunal? what opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of doing and receiving good have I let ſlip? have I not made it more my buſineſs to ſeem Religious, then really to be ſo? how much of the Patience of God have I abus'd? refuſing his calls to Repentance, reſiſting the ſtrivings of his Spirit, ſmothering my Convictions, and turning the grace of God into wantonneſs? In ſtead of returning gratitude for all his Love, I have repeated my Transgreſſions after Forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veneſs: and gone in a circle of Repenting and Sinning, even to this day. Lord, I am Aſham'd and lay my ſelf in the duſt before thee. To me belongs nothing but ſhame and confuſion of Face. If God ſhould condemn and puniſh
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:32504:148"/>me as a Rebell, and a Traitor, and give me the Portion of Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, I cannot but own his Juſtice; even in Hell I muſt do it, with my flaming Tongue and Breath.</p>
               <p>O Spare me for thy mercies ſake! <hi>Enter not into Judgment with thy ſervant, for in thy ſight ſhall no fleſh living be juſtifi'd: if Thou lay Judgment to the line, and equity to the Plummet.</hi> Give me Repentance unto life, <hi>never to be repented of,</hi> never to be retracted againe. Bring me to the Bloud of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which cleanſeth from <hi>all ſin.</hi> Behold the ſighings of a contrite Spirit: For <hi>I acknowleg my Transgreſſions unto thee, againſt whom I have ſinned; o Lord; forgive the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of my Sin.</hi> I am unworthy to lift up my hands and Eyes towards Heaven, unworthy to be called thy ſon, or thy ſervant: I am vile in mine own eyes, becauſe
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:32504:149"/>I have made my ſelf vile in thine. For this I am troubled, and mourn, and my Soul is grieved within me.</p>
               <p>O thou Heavenly Phyſitian of Souls! from thy Pitty alone I expect my cure. I am miſerable and undone without thy Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and expect no relief but from the Treaſure of thy Grace. I muſt periſh, and ſink under the burden of Sin, if thy mercifull hand doe not ſave me, and lift me up.

               <p>May I not yet <hi>hope in thy mercy?</hi> thou haſt mercyfully born with me hitherto: thou calleſt me to repent: thou commandeſt me to return, and promiſeſt to forgive
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:32504:149"/>thoſe Sins which are confeſſed and forſaken: O do not caſt me out of thy Sight and Preſence, now I deſire from the bottom of my Heart to return to thee! <hi>I abhorr my ſelf in duſt and ashes,</hi> for my paſt Iniquities. But alas! ſuch is the hardneſs of my Impenitent Heart, that I am even aſham'd of my humbleſt Repentance: how much more may God deſpiſe and reject it? But haſt thou not given thy H.

               </p>
               <p>Lord, hear my Prayer, and let not the mixture of my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and unworthineſs turn it into Sin: but graciouſly vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to look upon <hi>a returning Prodigal;</hi> and cauſe me to hear the voice of Joy and Gladneſs, that my ſorrowfull Heart may be comforted, and my life be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to thy Praiſe. Lead me into the path of life, that I may no longer erre from the way of thy Commandments: Teach me to
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:32504:150"/>do thy Will, o God, and write thy Law upon my heart, that I may never more <hi>return to Folly.</hi> I am convinc't of the Evill of Sin, of thy Right to govern me, of the equity and Juſtice of thy Law, of the ſweetneſs and rewards of keeping thy precepts: O ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my Heart, and make me <hi>Sound in thy Statutes,</hi> that I may hate every falſe way, and be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to thy Fear, the remainder of my Life.</p>
               <p>If there be any particular Luſt or Wickedneſs, which thro the power of Temptation, and the deceitfullneſs of Sin you have fallen into; that hath waſted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and robb'd you of your Peace, and provok't God to write bitter things againſt you; be ſure to humble your ſelf without delay in an eſpecial manner for that Backſliding: Confeſs it freely, with its aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:32504:151"/>Conſider wither it was not after ſome ſpecial manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God's Love, after ſome ſpecial warning, ſome ſtrong Conviction, under or ſoon after ſome great Affliction from God, or ſome more then ordinary kindneſs of his Providence, &amp;c. and impreſs ſuch Thoughts, to humble your ſelf the lower, ſearch into the grounds and cauſes of ſuch Apoſtacy, ſuch as the abatement of your watchfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the neglect of ſerious cloſet devotion, making bold with Temptation, too great compliance with vaine Company, venturing too far in lawfull or indifferent Things, too much Confidence in your own Wisdom, Strength and ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not fearing ſufficiently the Approaches and Beginnings of Sin, or avoiding the fuell, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centives, and occaſions of it,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:32504:151"/>&amp;c. Palliate and disguiſe nothing, that may make your ſin exceeding ſinfull, leaſt by ſome little Art of the Devil, you deceive your ſelf by an half-Repentance; and the Evil Spirit, you think to be caſt out, return againe with ſeven worſe then himſelf, and ſo your latter end be worſe then your Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. For if the ſin be not truly hated, but only cover'd over with penitential Aſhes, it will quickly flame out againe, when it meets with combuſtible matter, and a ſtrong blaſt of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation.</p>
               <p>But if you are griev'd to the very Heart, and abhorr the Sin, and reſolve to quitt it, you need not doubt of God's readineſs to receive you to Mercy. His Spirit is yet ſtriving with you, if you are willing to Repent, and return to God. He ſought you, and call'd you to return, when you were
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:32504:152"/>wandring as a loſt ſheep in the broad way; and can you think, he will not be found of you, if you ſeek him with your whole Heart? Therfore renew your Repentan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and beg more earneſtly a Spirit of Humility, Holy Fear, and Watchfullneſs: and every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning implore divine ſuccors againſt that Sin, and all <hi>Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> to it. (<hi>Which,</hi> as much as poſſible, you muſt avoid.) Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and fervent Prayer, after Repentance, muſt be your refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, and your Remedy. If you let fall your hands, this <hi>Amaleck</hi> will prevail againe: aſſoon and as far as you fail in the conſtancy, and fervency of that Duty, your Sin will get ſtrengh, and ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attempt you another Time. But by this practiſe, God may turn Evil to work for Good, make you gaine by your loſs, ſtand the faſter by your Falls, and become
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:32504:152"/>ſtronger by the diſcovery of your weakneſs, and better eſtabliſht for the future.</p>
               <p>But take heed that you pervert not the Grace of God, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage your ſelf to ſin againe by the ſuppoſition, that if you ſhould Fall, 'tis but to <hi>Repent,</hi> and renew your Reſolutions, and all will be well.

               <p>How ever Sin may ſmile in its firſt addreſs, and beſpeak us in flattering language, and promiſe Pleaſure, and Profit, and great Advantages and Satisfaction; Theſe are but fair Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; This is but the outſide of the Cup, and the colour of the Liquor: it will prove Gall and Wormwood, and a mixture of deadly Poiſon, if ever God ſet it home upon the Conſcience,

               <p>But how often, o my Soul, have I mockt God, and deceiv'd my ſelf, with formal and faint Purpoſes of amendment? my good Reſolutions have been all of them <hi>as the morning cloud, and the Early dew,</hi> which quickly paſſed away.

How often haſt thou open'd thine arms, and called me, yea beſeecht me to come unto thee, and accept of Life? but I refuſed, to come. I adore thy mercifull Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

I acknowledge thy Title to me, and my obedience, and to all I have, by dying for me. I deſire to take thy yoke upon me, for it is Eaſy; and thy Burden, which is Light.

Innumerable Calamities he ſaves me from, which Others groan under: and as many Bleſſings am I favor'd with, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof they are deſtitute.

               <p>Let me add for a <hi>Concluſion;</hi> that the particular Deliverances, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, and Conſolations, which at any time God hath given in caſes of great Exigence, or in anſwer to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate Prayer, ought never to be forgotten. Many experienc't Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have been wont to write down ſuch remarkable Appearances of God for them, with the particular Circumſtances, that did recommend and enhanſe the mercy, (wither Spiritual or Temporal,) as an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to truſt in God, in future difficulties: and have after<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wards found the Comfort and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:32504:182"/>of being able to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to ſuch Papers. This practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce I recommend as what hath been uſefull and Conſolatory to diverſe Chriſtians, for many years after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: and to ſome others, of their more intimate Friends, to whom they might without vanity be impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. What experiences might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of ſignal returns to Prayer, and ſeaſonable manifeſtations of the Truth, and Goodneſs, and wiſdom of God, if all the Inſtances therof were duely recollected and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd? And how ſweet and pleaſant would the work of Prayer and Praiſe then be? with what rejoycing and delight ſhould we ſet about it, &amp; live in it? if the conſtraining Goodneſs &amp; Love of God, and a Thankfull ſenſe of his unſpeakable mercies did bring us to him, and indite and animate every word? what ſupport and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and probable hopes (at leaſt) of the ſpecial Love of God might we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:32504:182"/>from the various paſſages of his Compaſſion and kindneſs? And he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby we may be able more heartily to give him thanks for Pardon, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and Adoption, which we commonly mention with too much doubt and fear.</p>
               <p>It may likewiſe be adviſable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine and record, the workings of your own Spirit, under ſuch Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations. What Thoughts you then had of God? what acts of Faith, Love, Thankfullneſs you did then manifeſt? what Evidences of God's favor, and what diſcovery of your own Sincerity, you have had at ſuch Times? when and how, and by what means you were cured of your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable unbelief, and raiſed from your deſpondency? what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes you had recourſe to for relief? what Conſiderations were moſt help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to you? what Frame of Spirit you kept up in Prayer, before and after? what Reſolutions and Engagements
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:32504:183"/>you made to God, to love, and truſt, and praiſe, and ſerve him, and give up all to his diſpoſe for the future? and what conſequent obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation may be infer'd from thence, to acquieſce in the Will of God and reſign our ſelves entirely to Him ſaying, <hi>This God is our God for ever and ever, and He will be Our Guide unto Death.</hi>
